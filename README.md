# LeetCodeSolutions
A collection of the solved LeetCode solutions explained on medium.

## IMPORTANT
This repository is not for execution; it is just a basis for medium readers to look up the code.
If you are interested in the series, visit [my medium page](https://medium.com/@ChrisBader). 

## Structure
The solutions are structured as followed.
+ The first approach, mostly called the naive approach, is named as in the LeetCode submission system.
+ Each iteration of the solution is marked with an increasing version number,e.g.: 
  + reverseInteger(int i) - The first approach
  + reverseIntegerV2(int i) - The improved solution
